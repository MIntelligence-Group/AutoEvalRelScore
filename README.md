## Code Files
The code files are currently private as the corresponding research paper in MIPR workshop is under review. They will be made publically available soon after the paper is published/accepted for publication.

Dataset Access
--------------
Access to the ‘IIT Roorkee Multimodal Feedback Synthesis (IIT-R MMFeed) dataset’ can be obtained by through [`Access Form - IIT-R MMFeed Dataset.pdf`][2]. The dataset is prepared at Machine Intelligence Lab, IIT Roorkee under the supervision of Prof. Balasubramanian Raman. It consists of 9,479 samples containing news text, images, user comments, and the number of likes for each comment.
